            The opportunity to unleash creativity and directly impact the world
            through technologies and user experience grows wings on me! I thrive
            in continuous learning and always eager to acquire new skills. As a
            positive and proactive person I strongly believe that collaboration
            unlocks diverse perspectives for win-win solutions and teamwork{" "}
            {/*the power of team work and the enriching
            experience of working with individuals from diverse backgrounds,*/}
            leads to personal and professional growth. As a self-starter, I
            bring a strong work ethic and optimistic approach to every project,
            striving for shared success.
            <p>
              <br /> At VIA University College, I have had hands-on experience
              with three-tier architecture using Blazor, .NET, and Java Spring
              Boot while working on the 3rd-semester project. Just to name a
              few. Currently learning C, DevOps, React and JavaScript. I'm
              excited about the opportunity to bring my dedication to an
              internship or a student job where we can learn and grow together.
